I've been thinking to move away from Blogspot for a while as I felt too constrained by the layout options and today I finally did it! This is my first take on Jekyll and hosting on Github. So far it went smoothly. I've used the theme from [Fabricio's blog](https://github.com/ronchifabricio/Blog). My [old blog](http://feraldeveloper.blogspot.co.uk) will stay online - but I intend to eventually migrate the content here.
